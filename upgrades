Your code looks mostly fine, but I noticed a few things that you might want to address:

    It seems like you have an indentation issue with the line net = Net() inside the Net class definition. You should move this line outside the class definition, after the forward method. Here's the corrected version:

python

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 34 * 34)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

net = Net()

    In the code snippet where you print the predicted class at the end, you have defined classes as ['class_0', 'class_1']. However, earlier in the code, you have defined classes as ['check', 'facture']. To maintain consistency, you should use the same class names in both places. Replace the classes definition at the end with the one you defined earlier:

python

# Print the predicted class
print('Predicted class:', classes[predicted.item()])

After making these changes, your code should work as expected. If you still encounter any issues or have questions about specific parts of the code, feel free to ask.
